        Your objective is to make a Ransomware file that will navigate through all the fake PC Files to find the Documents folder. And encrypt all the file data.
        A window should pop up stating that all the files have been encrypted and you need to enter a password to decrypt them.
        
        You should use your encryption and decryption tool from Problem 5.
        You are not allowed to import any libraries to assist you with the encryption.
        
        Setting up this project can be tricky and you could fuck up your pc if you havent set it up right.
        If you are confident setting it up then good. Otherwise please contact Tenuous for assistance.
        
        All code completed by the participant must be in this file.  
        
        Run the code before starting the problem, to make sure that nothing is wrong.
        If you do have a problem related to running the code, contact 'Tenuous'.
        
        Remove the comments and code here when ready.
        
        Enjoy Problem 3
