        Your objective to to create a tool, from sratch, that can encrypt and decrypt a file.
        The encryption should appropriately randomize the items in the file so that its unreadable.
        The decryption should be able to convert the file back into its original state, so the file is readable.
        
        You are not allowed to use any imports to help you other than the ones already added to this file, they wont help you though.
        
        You should have been given one other file than this one. That being "IMPORTANT_WORK_DATA.txt".
        "IMPORTANT_WORK_DATA.txt" contains a list the 100 Usernames, Emails, and Passwords of colleague data.
        
        I should've posted a video covering how to use a "Class" in python by now. As I am aware that not everyone will understand how to complete this problem by using Classes.
        So if you don't know how to use them, please watch the video. Or do some research on how to use them. I really want you to attempt Problem 5 because its a really
        fun and interesting problem to solve. 
        
        All code completed by the participant must be in this file.  
        
        Run the code before starting the problem, to make sure that nothing is wrong.
        If you do have a problem related to running the code, contact 'Tenuous'.
        
        Remove the comments and code here when ready.
        
        Enjoy Problem 5
