A Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers in the sequence.

Write a program that generate the Fibonacci sequence for the number of iterations wanted. The output must be in the form of a list.



Example:

Input: n = 5
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
